This is an integration of MiDaS (a monocular depth estimator deep learning model) to Android in JNI context (C++ interface of Java). In this project, I tried to show that how
MiDaS or any other TensorFlow Lite model can be loaded through assets, used with TensorFlow Lite C++ API and perform some image processing operations with respect to
inferred values from TensorFlow Lite with OpenCV in Android.
